# 🌸 Hi, I'm Alyssa 🌸
🌻 Welcome to my growing portfolio showcasing labs and projects in Linux administration, system security, and cybersecurity. 

## 📖 Currently Learning
- Linux command line and system admin
- Network security basics
- Virtualization (Hyper-V, VirtualBox)
- Open-source software fundamentals

## 🚧 Portfolio Projects 🚧

To showcase my learning and hands-on experience, this portfolio now includes three featured projects:

### Portfolio Projects

- [Virtualization Practice Environment](virtualization_setup.txt) — Commands to create, configure, and start a Linux VM.
- [Process Management](process_lab.txt) — Common Linux commands for monitoring and managing processes.
- [File and Permissions Management](file_permissions.txt) — Commands for creating files/directories, changing permissions, and verifying changes.



## 📍 Future Goals
- Expand my virtual lab environment with multiple VMs and networking setups, building on my VirtualBox project.
- Practice shell scripting to automate tasks like file management, process monitoring, and VM configuration.
- Explore more cybersecurity tools and configurations

## 🍀 My Journey
I'm still early in my IT degree, but I truly enjoy learning how systems work and how we secure them. 
This space will continue to grow as I do.
