# Hi, I'm Alyssa :)
My growing portfolio showcasing labs and projects in Linux administration, system security, and cybersecurity. 

## Currently Learning
- Linux command line and system admin
- Network security basics
- Virtualization (Hyper-V, VirtualBox)
- Open-source software fundamentals

## Portfolio Projects

To showcase my learning and hands-on experience, this portfolio now includes three featured projects:

### 1. VirtualBox VM Setup
Commands to create, configure, and start a Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox.  
**File:** `virtualization_setup.txt`

### 2. Process Management
Common Linux commands for monitoring and managing processes (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, etc.).  
**File:** `process-_lab.txt`

### 3. File and Permissions Management
Commands for creating files/directories, changing permissions, ownership, and verifying changes.  
**File:** `file_permissions.txt`


## Future Goals
- Expand my virtual lab environment with multiple VMs and networking setups, building on my VirtualBox project.
- Practice shell scripting to automate tasks like file management, process monitoring, and VM configuration.
- Explore more cybersecurity tools and configurations

## My Journey
I'm still quite early in my IT degree, but I truly enjoy learning how systems work and how we secure them. 
This space will continue to grow as I do.
