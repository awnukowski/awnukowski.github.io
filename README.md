# 🌸 Hi, I'm Alyssa 🌸
🌻 Welcome to my growing portfolio showcasing labs and projects in Linux administration, system security, and cybersecurity. 

## 📖 Currently Learning
- Linux command line and system administration
- Network security basics
- Virtualization (Hyper-V, VirtualBox, Proxmox, GCP VMs)
- Open-source software fundamentals

## 🚧 Portfolio Projects 🚧

To showcase my learning and hands-on experience, this portfolio now includes three featured projects:

### Virtualization Practice Environment
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/users/awnukowski/projects/4)

**Overview:** Commands to create and configure a Linux VM using VirtualBox.  
**Tools/Skills Used:** VirtualBox, Linux, VM configuration, disk management, ISO installation, terminal commands  
**Reflection:** I learned how to create and configure virtual machines from scratch, including memory, CPU, and storage settings. Using the terminal to manage VMs helped me understand the steps behind virtualization, preparing me for real-world IT environments.

- [Process Management](https://github.com/users/awnukowski/projects/3) — Common Linux commands for monitoring and managing processes.
- [File and Permissions Management](https://github.com/users/awnukowski/projects/5) — Commands for creating files/directories, changing permissions, and verifying changes.



## 📍 Future Goals
- Expand my virtual lab environment with multiple VMs and networking setups, building on my VirtualBox project.
- Practice shell scripting to automate tasks like file management, process monitoring, and VM configuration.
- Explore more cybersecurity tools and configurations

## 🍀 My Journey
I'm still early in my IT degree, but I truly enjoy learning how systems work and how we secure them. 
This space will continue to grow as I do.
